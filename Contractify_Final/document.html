            </p>
            <p>
                6. Confidentiality.
            <p class="indent">
            <p>
                a. Confidential and Proprietary Information. In the course of performing the Services, Independent
                Contractor will be exposed to confidential and proprietary information of Client. “Confidential
                Information” shall mean any data or information that is competitively sensitive material and not
                generally known to the public, including, but not limited to, information relating to development and
                plans, marketing strategies, finance, operations, systems, proprietary concepts, documentation, reports,
                data, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, data, databases,
                inventions, know-how, trade secrets, customer lists, customer relationships, customer profiles, supplier
                lists, supplier relationships, supplier profiles, pricing, sales estimates, business plans and internal
                performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities, technical information,
                designs, processes, procedures, formulas or improvements, which Client considers confidential and
                proprietary. Independent Contractor acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is
                valuable property of Client, developed over a long period of time at substantial expense and that it is
                worthy of protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                b. Confidentiality Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, Independent
                Contractor shall not disclose or use in any manner, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information
                either during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, except as required to perform the
                Services or with Client’s prior written consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                c. Rights in Confidential Information. All Confidential Information disclosed to Independent Contractor
                by Client (i) is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Client, and (ii) is disclosed or
                permitted to be acquired by Independent Contractor solely in reliance on Independent Contractor’s
                agreement to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence and not to use or disclose the
                Confidential Information to any other person. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement does
                not confer any right, license, ownership or other interest in or title to the Confidential Information
                to Independent Contractor.

            </p>
            <p>
                d. Irreparable Harm. Independent Contractor acknowledges that use or disclosure of any Confidential
                Information in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement will give rise to irreparable injury for which
                damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other legal remedies which may
                be available at law or in equity, Client shall be entitled to equitable or injunctive relief against the
                unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information. Client shall be entitled to pursue any other
                legally permissible remedy available as a result of such breach, including but not limited to, damages,
                both direct and consequential. In any action brought by Client under this Section, Client shall be
                entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs from Independent Contractor.

                created and developed by Independent Contractor in connection with the performance of the Services under
                this Agreement and any resulting intellectual property rights (collectively, the “Work Product”) are the
                sole and exclusive property of Client. The Parties acknowledge that the Work Product shall, to the
                extent permitted by law, be considered a “work made for hire” within the definition of Section 101 of
                the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, (the “Copyright Act”) and that Client is deemed to be the author
                and is the owner of all copyright and all other rights therein. If the work product is not deemed to be
                a “work made for hire” under the Copyright Act, then Independent Contractor hereby assigns to Client all
                of Independent Contractor’s rights, title and interest in and to the Work Product, including but not
                limited to all copyrights, publishing rights and rights to use, reproduce and otherwise exploit the Work
                Product in any and all formats, media, or all channels, whether now known or hereafter created.

                of insurance, with appropriate and adequate coverage and limits, to cover any claims for bodily injury,
                property damage or other losses which might arise out of any negligent act or omission committed by
                Independent Contractor or Independent Contractor’s employees or agents, if any, in connection with the
                performance of the Services under this Agreement.

                Contractor
                will not, directly or indirectly, perform or engage in the same or similar activities as were performed
                for Client for any business that is directly or indirectly in completion with Client.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. Non-Solicit. Independent Contractor agrees and covenants that for a period of working months following
                the termination of this Agreement, Independent Contractor will not, directly or indirectly, solicit any
                officer, director or employee, or any customer, client, supplier or vendor of Client for the purpose of
                inducing such party to terminate its relationship with Client in favor of Independent Contractor or
                another business directly or indirectly in competition with Client.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. Mutual Representations and Warranties. Both Client and Independent Contractor represent and warrant
                that each Party has full power, authority and right to execute and deliver this Agreement, has full
                power and authority to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and has taken all necessary action
                to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement. No other consents are necessary to enter into

                of this Agreement by Independent Contractor.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. Disputes. Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be resolved through mediation. If the
                dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the dispute will be resolved through binding
                arbitration conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
